# Nextjs Page Generator
Inspired by project ChatGPT powered React Code Generator which already allows you to specify what kind of React component you want to build and directly get the code and a live preview. 

With Nextjs Page Generator you can easily craft UI for your Nextjs project using Tailwindcss. Use chat to continue your UI as if you're coding it. Engineers can use it to draft up several pages to copy as pages  main code base. If starting from scratch, you can export preview to CodeSandbox where you can develop in a devbox and initiate a Github Repo. The code generated by Nextjs Page Generator is styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or plain inline CSS.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to have a playground for frontend developers to quickly generate and tweak and export AI generated UI. In the current state it supports TailwindCSS and plain inline CSS but this could easily be extended with prompting.

Future investments includes:
- Support for other styling frameworks (Shadcn imports TSX & Stackblitz)
- Auto-save and deploy projects to Vercel or Netlify
- Provide context to an existing project that needs to be extended

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with `yarn`, `npm` or `pnpm`.


Set your OpenAI key by running the setup script `./setup.sh`. 
Or by editing `.env.local` if you're running this code locally.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
